1. this will create a login for SQL SERVER
The CHECK_EXPIRATION option determines whether the password expiration policy should be enforced on this login. The CHECK_EXPIRATION can be ON or OFF. The default value is OFF.

The following shows the CREATE LOGIN statement with the CHECK_EXPIRATION option:

CREATE LOGIN login_name
WITH PASSWORD = password, 
CHECK_EXPIRATION = {ON | OFF};
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
Note that the CHECK_EXPIRATION option is applied to SQL Server logins only.

The MUST_CHANGE option
To prompt the users for a new password the first time they log in, you use the MUST_CHANGE option. When you use the MUST_CHANGE option, the CHECK_POLICY and CHECK_EXPIRATION must be ON. Otherwise, the statement will fail.

CREATE LOGIN alice
WITH PASSWORD = 'UcxSj12.' MUST_CHANGE,
     CHECK_POLICY=ON, 
     CHECK_EXPRIATION=ON;
